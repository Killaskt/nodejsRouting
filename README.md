# nodejsRouting
A very simple Node app that maps html documents to a dynamic url function. Project was created to experience express.js 'under the hood'. 
This project allowed me to understand node at a deeper level utilizing it's http core module and see how much work express.js handles itself with its various middlewear and methods. 
Utilized the http module, fs module, and a few others.

> 1. npm install or git i, to install dependencies
> 2. npm run dev (to run with nodemon) or npm run start (to run regular)
> (runs on port 5000, just so you know)
